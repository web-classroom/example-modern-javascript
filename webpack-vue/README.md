# Webpack-vue demo

The project demonstrates how to configure webpack and [vue-loader](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/) to support Vue SFC (Single File Component) format and use [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) to have a better developper experience (automatically recompile the project and update the page when a module is saved).

## Usage

1. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the server in development mode
3. Run `npm run build` to compile the project for production in the `dist` folder
